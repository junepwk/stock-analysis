# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project 

### Purpose

The goal was to assist Steve in analyzing stocks data to help his parents commit to the right investment using VBA script in Excel.  The script written compared different green energy stocks data for years 2017 and 2018 by calculating the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock.  To further expand on this analytic request, a refactored code was written to allow Steve to run analyses on larger stock datasets.  This refactored code would prompt users to input the year they would like to analyze and  provide the time it took to execute with a single click of a button.
